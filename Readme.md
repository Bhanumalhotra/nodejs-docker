Here's a brief description of each component:

index.js: The main entry point of your application. It sets up the Express server, establishes connections to the MongoDB and Redis databases, and defines the server's routes.
config/config: Contains the configuration variables required for your application, such as database credentials, URLs, and session secrets.
routes/postRoutes and routes/userRoutes: Define the routes for handling post-related and user-related API endpoints, respectively. These route files receive requests and call the appropriate controller functions to handle them.
controllers/postController and controllers/userController: Handle the business logic for the post-related and user-related API endpoints, respectively. They interact with the models to perform CRUD operations on the data.
models/post and models/user: Represent the data models for posts and users, respectively. They define the schema and interact with the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
MongoDB Database: Stores the data for posts and users. The models interact with the MongoDB database to read and write data.
Redis Database: Used for session storage. The Redis client interacts with the Redis database to store and retrieve session data.



Here's a high-level flow of the application based on the provided code:

The application starts by importing the required modules and configuration variables.

The Redis client is initialized using the provided Redis connection details.

Route handlers for posts and users are imported.

The Express application is created.

The application attempts to connect to the MongoDB database using the provided MongoDB connection details. It retries the connection if it fails.

The app enables trust proxy to trust the proxy server.

CORS middleware is applied to allow cross-origin requests.

The express-session middleware is set up to manage sessions. It uses Redis as the session store.

JSON parsing middleware is applied to parse incoming request bodies in JSON format.

A basic route is defined for the root URL (/api/v1). It sends a simple HTML response and logs a message to the console.

The post and user routes are registered, associating them with their respective routers.

The server starts listening on the specified port (or default 3000), and a message is logged to the console indicating the server is running.

Here's the flow of the application when a request is received:

When a request is received by the server, it goes through the middleware in the order they are defined.

The CORS middleware allows or rejects the request based on the configured CORS policy.

The express-session middleware extracts the session data from the request. If a session ID is present, it retrieves the session data from Redis.

The request is then passed to the appropriate route handler based on the URL path.

The route handler performs any necessary operations, such as reading from or writing to the MongoDB database.

The handler prepares the response and sends it back to the client.

This flow ensures that requests are properly routed, sessions are managed using Redis, and data is retrieved or stored in the MongoDB database as needed.

Please note that this is a simplified overview, and the actual flow may involve additional details depending on the complexity of the route handlers and middleware used in the application.
